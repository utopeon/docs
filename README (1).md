# History

It was 2 AM on a Saturday in the greatest place on earth - Queens in New York City. Two brothers are in one of their very small childhood bedrooms brainstorming new ideas. They share a lifetime of gaming, learning, and working together to build all kinds of projects.&#x20;





One is a social network and forum for avid gamers called GaminGrounds.



They both have a greater knowledge of computer software and hardware. Together, they are a force to be reckoned with.

E-commerce? Software as a service? Hours passed with no sustainable ideas. The sleep deprived mind can create wonders. "We need to think bigger. What are we really good at? What inspires us?" says Roach A.

Together they made a list:&#x20;

* Elon Musk
* Space
* Artificial Intelligence
* Blockchain
* Cryptocurrency
* Gaming

"We need to create something that will change the world forever," they agreed.

Roach A is a part-time gamer, only playing a couple free games like Warzone or Apex on their free time with friends. Roach B is a full-time gamer, buying games and playing all the time. The problem was clear: a part-time gamer has other sources of income and a full-time gamer has no income. What does a part-time gamer want that could be bought from a full-time gamer? Well, time is the most valuable finite resource. With income, a full-time gamer can invest in themselves and their gaming career. How do we connect everyone in a way never seen before?

"I wish I could compete with my friends for money", says Roach A, "I have money and you're broke. What if you earned a different currency for gaming and I bought it to use as a wager against my friends?"

Together, both roaches created what is currently known as Utopeon, the concept of an all-access blockchain eSports and gaming community. They wrote a whitepaper to thoroughly explain the specific details of the project. The leadership team of childhood friends considered family was brought together, growing quickly as others read the whitepaper and became inspired to join and contribute.
