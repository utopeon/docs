# Motivation

TLDR; Video gaming and esports are massive industries growing exponentially, yet loyal players are left behind in the dust and unsupported. Money moves in one direction and is consolidated at the top 0.1%. The pipeline problem makes it difficult and discouraging for newbies to become professionals. Long-term video gaming and esports growth are threatened.

## Video Gaming

### Industry

As of 2023, there are more than 3 billion active video gamers worldwide. That means more than 40% of the human population play video games for a period of time throughout their life.&#x20;

The rate of industry growth is exponential - at an astonishing average rate of 5.6% year-over-year.

### Income

Less than 0.1% of gamers earn anything, with less than 500 earning more than $150,000 USD per year. Yet the industry is valued at over $180 billion and is projected to double by 2025.&#x20;

Most of the volume is moving in one direction - to the top developers, content creators (streamers), and professional players. Leaving very little room for exposure, and growth for talented independent individuals.

## eSports

eSports, or electronic sports, is a form of competitive video gaming where players and teams compete against each other in organized tournaments and leagues. In esports, players compete for prizes in a variety of different games, such as first-person shooters, real-time strategy games, fighting games, and sports games. These games are played on various platforms, including computers, gaming consoles, and mobile devices.

Esports tournaments and leagues are typically organized by game developers, esports organizations, or third-party companies. These events can take place online or in person and can feature a range of prize pools, from small local competitions to large international tournaments with millions of dollars in prizes.

### Industry

Esports has grown in popularity over the years and has become a professional sport with a large following. It is a rapidly growing industry, with millions of fans and spectators around the world.&#x20;

With this explosive popularity, the industry has also created opportunities for players, coaches, analysts, and other professionals to make careers in esports. But also others have selfishly benefited exponentially greater from this growth, more than teams, players, or individual contributors that made it possible.

The gaming community, esports revenue, and viewership continue to grow as monetization and innovation are slow, making it difficult for any esports platform to be considered a major league.&#x20;

### Income

On average, professional gamers only earn between $12,000 and $60,000 per year, depending on the games they play and their level of skill. But the grim reality is, only a minority enjoys any kind of salary. The odds of becoming a professional player are \~0.00008%.&#x20;

The industry favors only the most popular, best winners. There is little to no room for ordinary or growing players to earn or compete. Financial rewards often come once you are signed into a team. Aspiring gamers rarely rise in this highly competitive field, leaving them hopeless and struggling for years trying to grow and be noticed by recruiters.

## Problems that need solving

### The Pipeline Problem

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (22).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Gaming is an acquired skill. Like most skilled labor, this presents a dilemma where if skill demands training, but the training itself is not profitable, who supports learning until accumulated skill can pay for itself? This dilemma is commonly known as the pipeline problem.&#x20;

Unlike ordinary sports, esports and gaming have no formal processes for turning amateur players into professionals.&#x20;

### Lapsed Players

As these industries have grown, so have organizational challenges associated with them. The community is fragmented into different professions and platforms with very little sense of community. Players are stretched across games, teams, and platforms such as Twitch, YouTube Live, and Facebook Gaming.&#x20;

Such centralized platforms and marketplaces have dominated, with most of the power in the hands of very few, large groups. Loyal ordinary players are left behind in the dust and unsupported. Most ultimately leave the industry entirely as they get older which explains why most gamers are young adults.
