# Welcome

Documentation is a long-term effort that requires a tremendous amount of love and support from a well-established community like the one here. It is not easy but it is essential for success. It's important to educate newcomers on this new and evolving technology. There should be little to no confusion about the industry, company, product, features, etc. Answers to your questions should be here. If they are not, please [reach out](introduction/contact-us.md).

This knowledge library is open source. Anyone can fork [the repository](https://github.com/utopeon/docs) and submit a pull request with new information or improvements to existing pages. Help us educate newcomers not only about Utopeon but also about [blockchain](decentralization/blockchains.md), [cryptocurrencies](blockchain/cryptocurrencies.md), [NFTs](blockchain/non-fungible-token-nft.md), [Web3](blockchain/wallets.md), and [play-to-earn video gaming](introduction/welcome/mission.md#\_2e).&#x20;

The Utopeon GitHub is partially public: [https://github.com/utopeon](https://github.com/utopeon). Being open and transparent is important. Some work will be made open source so other engineers can contribute.&#x20;

[GitHub discussions](https://github.com/orgs/utopeon/discussions) are used for technical support, product questions, ideas/suggestions and so much more.&#x20;

:heart: Thank you so much for reading and contributing. Your support is greatly appreciated. A big warm welcome to all the new community members! :hugging:
