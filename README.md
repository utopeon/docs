# Welcome

Documentation is a long-term effort that will require a tremendous amount of love and support from a well-established community like the one we are building here. It's not easy but it is essential for our success. It's incredibly important to educate newcomers on this new and quickly evolving technology. There should be little to no confusion about the industry, company, product, features, etc. Answers to your questions should be here. If they are not, please [reach out](introduction/contact-us.md).

This knowledge library is open source. Anyone can fork [the repository](https://github.com/utopeon/docs) and submit a pull request with new information or improvements to existing pages. Help us educate newcomers not only about Utopeon but also about [blockchain](decentralization/blockchains.md), [cryptocurrencies](blockchain/cryptocurrencies.md), [NFTs](blockchain/non-fungible-token-nft.md), [Web3](blockchain/wallets.md), and [play-to-earn video gaming](introduction/welcome/mission.md#\_2e).&#x20;

Being open and transparent is important, which is why our GitHub is partially public: [https://github.com/utopeon](https://github.com/utopeon).&#x20;

We will make some of our work open source so other engineers can contribute to this project and support the mission.&#x20;

We will also use discussions ([https://github.com/orgs/utopeon/discussions](https://github.com/orgs/utopeon/discussions)) so anyone can submit product issues, questions, ideas/suggestions and so much more.&#x20;

:heart: Thank you so much for reading and contributing. Your support is greatly appreciated. A big warm welcome to all the new community members! :hugging:
