**Utopeon is proudly 100% free to use.**&#x20;

We are doing this for the greater [mission](welcome/mission.md). For humans and gamers alike. Utopeon relies on community support to continue pursuing [the mission](welcome/mission.md). It's important that if you'd like to see this project succeed, join and be an active member. Participate daily and engage with others to make this a fun and safe place for everyone.

From the moment a stable product is launched, Utopeon founders will continue investing personal assets to build, maintain and grow the community. With more activity and traction, the project will earn enough to stay online - primarily through advertisements, sponsorships, partnerships, and fees. If there is insufficient income for a long period of time, the project, unfortunately, will need to be abandoned and the product will be discontinued.

Treat your credits like a valuable asset. Do not sell them without considering first how much is your time and energy worth to you. Stand firmly by that price. As the platform becomes busier, it will become more difficult to earn credits and the value of each credit will increase.&#x20;
