# Common Questions

<details>

<summary>Was there or will there be an Initial Coin Offering (ICO)? </summary>

Many decentralized startups build excitement around their project and then sell their token (cryptocurrency) to raise funds like shares for a company. This process, however, is highly unregulated and there is a common stigma surrounding organizations that chose to raise money in this fashion, primarily because most ultimately are scams.

Utopeon Credits ($UTCR) did not and will never engage in an Initial Coin Offering. The token is earned, bought, sold, exchanged, and utilized on Utopeon.&#x20;

<summary>Is Utopeon decentralized or centralized?</summary>

There are many key parts that make a decentralized application (dApp), such as data, authentication, and architecture.

Utopeon is partially decentralized, leaning more decentralized than centralized.&#x20;

Authentication is anonymous - minimal personal data is collected or stored. Web2 (email address or phone number) and Web3 (wallet) identifiers are accepted for new accounts. Privacy and security are top priorities.

Utopeon does not take advantage of fully decentralized architecture (yet) such as Decentralized Web Node (DWNs).&#x20;

Transactions are off-chain. For now, they are centralized and exclusively made on the platform until there is a withdrawal. Tokens are transferred on-chain from private and secure cold wallets powered by [Ledgers](../decentralization/ledgers.md). This gives us the opportunity to earn more from fees and monitor/maintain the platform, observing for abusive behavior.

Long-term Utopeon will explore greater adoption of decentralized blockchain technologies.

<summary>What is a play-to-earn video gaming economy?</summary>

A video game economy is an online social economy that exists on the internet, sometimes exclusive to a game. It is a virtual system of trade and commerce where players can buy, sell, and trade virtual goods, such as items, resources, and currency, using in-game currency or real money.&#x20;

The economy is often designed to mimic real-world economies, with supply and demand, market fluctuations, and inflation. For [play-to-earn](welcome/mission.md#\_2e) economies, gamers earn currency by simply playing, competing in events, selling items, or general participation. They can then use this currency to purchase items from other players or from in-game vendors.&#x20;

The value of the virtual currency is determined by supply and demand. For example, if the coins are in high demand, their price will increase. Conversely, if there is an oversupply and underutilization of the currency, its price will decrease.&#x20;

Utopeon is powered by [Uteopeon Credits ($UTCR)](usdutcr/) exclusively. Players can use real money to purchase credits to use later on events or items. This is known as microtransactions, and it is our most significant source of revenue. Utopeon monitors the economy closely and makes adjustments to ensure that the economy remains balanced and fair.&#x20;

Developers can build integrations to offer in-game purchases. They may introduce new items or adjust the price of existing items to maintain the health of the economy and themselves.

Video game economies are the future of [game finance (GameFi)](../decentralization/game-finance-gamefi.md) and esports. It adds a layer of complexity and depth to the gameplay. It can also be an interesting case study for economists, as it provides a unique example of a virtual economy that operates under different rules than the real world.

<summary>What type of esport events are there?</summary>

**Tournaments**

Similar to most tournaments, teams of players will compete to achieve the apex position as the sole winner of the prize. In most cases, teams will exchange credits to participate in a tournament and the prize will be very large and evenly distributed between the players of the winning team. Teams will work together to advance their way through a bracket, spanning several days, weeks, or months-long with intermittent breaks. Tournaments are almost always live-streamed, monitored, and tracked through our artificial intelligence.

**Competitions**

Organized competitions are a public, temporary group goal. They can vary in expiration, entry cost, and minimum “pot” reward. Anyone can join a competition. Entry costs are fair and automatically determined based on difficulty. Entries are transferred to a secure private escrow wallet. The more players that enter a competition, the higher the reward.

**Challenges**

A challenge is a private, temporary individual goal established between players and the platform. They can vary in expiration, entry cost, and fixed rewards.&#x20;

Examples:

* Eliminate 10 players using melee only within 24 hours. (Likelihood 1 of every 10)&#x20;
  * 20 tokens to enter, 40 tokens when completed (100% reward).
* Successfully win 10 games within 12 hours. (Likelihood 1 of every 100)
  * 10 tokens to enter, 50 tokens when completed (500% reward).
