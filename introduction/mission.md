# Mission

TLDR; A decentralized video gaming economy with automated esports will introduce competitive features to everyone around the world and at every skill level. Monetization of gameplay will result in increased player retention and the return of lapsed players. It's a win for all.

## \_2E

\_2E is our shorthand for (blank)-to-earn.&#x20;

This social model involves rewarding or providing compensation to individuals learning or practicing a unique skill or trade. The individual, therefore, has an opportunity to become a professional. As a professional, they earn more and return greater contributions to the social environment, stimulating economic activity. It is a new yet feasible option for solving [the pipeline problem](../#the-pipeline-problem) for humans.&#x20;

## Home of the Full-time Gamerâ„¢

Utopeon is a decentralized P2E (**P**lay-**T**o-**E**arn) video gaming economy powered by a blockchain token known as [`Utopeon Credits ($UTCR)`](usdutcr/). A decentralized video gaming economy is an ecosystem where gamers, developers, and investors can interact with each other without intermediaries. This means more money is moving into the pockets of those who deserve it most.

We invest in full-time gamers by monetizing gameplay. We believe that through proper utilization, such monetization will prove to be profitable for everyone, balancing the industry. Our short-term investment in amateur players will lead to greater returns when they become professionals.&#x20;

Utopeon is a unique combination of play-to-earn and in some ways, pay-to-win, optimizing for social and utility value. This will increase the entertainment threshold and work towards closing the industry gaps.

## Utopeon Credits ($UTCR)

The only way to earn $UTCR is through invested time and energy actually playing video games. The more you play, and the better you play, the more you earn. Use $UTCR to participate in competitions, challenges, tournaments and so much more.&#x20;

**Need more credits for an action or activity?**&#x20;

Utopeon only gives and receives credits, it does not buy or sell credits. Credits can be purchased from other players selling on the market. Transactions on the platform are facilitated for a small fee (in $UTCR, of course). This fee changes slightly based on volume. Exchange, processing, and moderation fees return value to the organization and effectively remove credits from the market. This private reserve is reused for maintenance and growth.

### Software and Data

An overlay software quietly monitors gameplay, collecting and analyzing in-game data. As in-game data is gathered across thousands of games and millions of players worldwide, there is an opportunity to leverage the data such as discovering unique talent quickly and easily. This data can also be modeled and sold (in $UTCR, of course) to amateurs to help them become better players.

eSports events are automated using complex mathematic equations and artificial intelligence to maintain market balance based on supply and demand.

## More than gaming

As humans continue to evolve, we must ask ourselves what does the future hold for us?&#x20;

Roughly 1.7 million jobs have been lost due to automation in the last 20 years. Artificial intelligence is quickly advancing and threatening employment for millions of people worldwide. Restaurants are entirely powered by robots, software to create dynamically generated photos, and language learning models writing entire code for applications.

Play-to-earn (P2E) or learn-to-earn (L2E) - is there a difference? In both principles, individuals build their knowledge and skillset through invested time and effort. Later, this person will earn and contribute more independently as a professional.

Monetizing the process of learning and growth is investing in people with potential, supporting their success, and creating new opportunities for them. This smaller investment will return greater long-term contributions to a much bigger social economy.&#x20;
